# Anti Brute Force
## Key derivation function for defense against brute force attacks
## (Argon3 candidate)

This Key derivation function software is proposed as a valid alternative to Argon2, focusing on the simplicity of the solution and the easy understanding of the mechanisms adopted.

This project aims to create a simple solution, reduced to the minimum terms, understandable by anyone with a basic knowledge of cryptography.
Very complex, convoluted and daring systems generate many mechanisms in which dangerous pitfalls can hide. By reducing this process to the minimum terms with a minimalist solution to the problem, we wanted to create a system that is truly verifiable and testable by a large number of scholars interested in the topic. We have nominated this algorithm as Argon3 Candidate (improvement of Argon2 for the reasons described here).
